## Features

<!--
A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

- Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical, philosophical, or both) important to the user‚Äôs understanding.
- Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
- State if it is out-of-the-box user-friendly, so it‚Äôs clear to the user.
- List its most useful/innovative/noteworthy features.
- State its goals/what problem(s) it solves.

Managing Docker images, containers and networks from the command line while also trying to monitor crucial metrics can be tedious and counterintuitive. To make this process more developer-friendly, we created Docketeer: a container management platform for Docker.


## Install

1. **Fork** and **clone** this [repository](https://github.com/open-source-labs/Docketeer.git) to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/open-source-labs/Docketeer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project's top-level directory.

4. Configure environment variables for Twilio API. Refer to **Twilio Setup** section below.

5. Create a folder called `security` in the project's top-level directory.

6. Inside of the `security` folder, create two files `email.js` and `sysadmin.js`. These files will store variables related to the email notification service and system admin setup respectively.

7. Connect your cloud relational database (PostgreSQL) by copying and pasting the connection string to the variable `PG_URI` the file `cloudModel.js` located in `Docketeer/server/models/`.

8. You are all set! Now just enter the following command to start up Docketeer!
```
npm run dev
```

## Twilio setup
    1. Download the helper library from https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install
    2. In order to manage Twilio SMS notifications follow the step plan : https://www.twilio.com/docs/notify/quickstart/sms#messagingservice
    3. Store your (i) Twilio number, (ii) Account Sid, (iii) Auth Token from twilio.com/console, (iv) SERVICE_SID, (v) verification service SID in a newly created .env file in the Docketeer folder in the following format:

     MY_PHONE_NUMBER='your mobile number'
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID='code from your console'
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN='token from your console'
     SERVICE_SID='code from notify service instance'
     VERIFICATION_SERVICE_SID='code from verify service instance'

    4. Verification service was created here: https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services code length and serviceSID can be taken from your Twilio account console.
    5. All historical messages from the Twilio account can be found here: https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs


<!-- > Getting started with Docketeer is easy: visit [docketeer.io](https://www.docketeer.io/) and download the Docketeer desktop app. Drag and drop the .dmg file that you downloaded into your Applications folder to install it. Before you run the application, make sure Docker itself is running. -->


## Basic usage

### Settings

> On the settings page you can set up container specific sms notifications along with notification rules and connect containers to specific github repositories.
