Managing Docker images, containers and networks from the command line while also trying to monitor crucial metrics can be tedious and counterintuitive. To make this process more developer-friendly, we created Docketeer: a GUI for Docker.

Download our app: [https://www.docketeer.io/](https://www.docketeer.io/)


## üë∂ Install

<!-- > Getting started with Docketeer is easy: visit [docketeer.io](https://www.docketeer.io/) and download the Docketeer desktop app. Drag and drop the .dmg file that you downloaded into your Applications folder to install it. Before you run the application, make sure Docker itself is running. -->


### Basic usage

#### Running Containers

>Once you open the app, you will be able to see any containers that are already running. You can stop or see more details about any container with the click of a button. You can also run a container based on the id or repo of an image from the top-right.

#### Exited Containers

> On the Exited Containers tab, you can view the containers that exited or were stopped. You can click to re-run or remove any exited container.
